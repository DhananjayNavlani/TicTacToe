# Tictactoe

The "Tictactoe" project is a Java application developed using the JavaFX framework. It offers a classic implementation of the popular game Tictactoe, where two players take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.

## Features

- **Graphical User Interface:** The application provides an intuitive and visually appealing graphical user interface (GUI) built using JavaFX. This allows users to interact with the game easily and enjoy a seamless gaming experience.

- **Two-player Mode:** The Tictactoe game supports a two-player mode, enabling two individuals to play against each other on the same device. Players take turns marking spaces on the grid with their respective symbols (X or O).

- **Winning Conditions:** The game includes logic to determine the winner. It checks for winning combinations on the grid and declares the player who achieves three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) as the winner. If no player achieves this condition, the game ends in a draw.

- **Game Reset:** After a game is completed (either by a win or a draw), the players have the option to reset the game by running the program again and start a new round.

## Description

The "Tictactoe" project provides a digital rendition of the classic Tictactoe game, bringing the excitement and challenge to your computer screen. With the user-friendly GUI built using JavaFX, players can easily engage in matches and put their strategic skills to the test.

In the two-player mode, two participants can take turns playing against each other on the same device. Each player marks their chosen grid space with their corresponding symbol, either an "X" or an "O." The application validates the moves and ensures that players cannot overwrite each other's symbols.

The game includes logic to determine the winner. It constantly checks the grid for winning combinations, such as three consecutive symbols in a row, column, or diagonal with the help of event listeners. When a player achieves this condition, they are declared the winner, and the game ends. If all spaces on the grid are filled, and no winning condition is met, the game ends in a draw
